# Graham Scan Visualization Tool

This is a tool to visualize the Graham Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of random points.
[Download the .jar to test it out!](https://github.com/Incandescent-Turtle/graham-scan-visualizer/raw/master/out/artifacts/grahams_scan_jar/grahams-scan.jar)

## Customization

- select which shape to generate points in
- random shape generation
- change the amount of dots
- change the delay and step size to control the speed of the algorithm
- toggle visibility of both the dots and the lines showing the hull
- a "loop" option to continue generating and finding the hull of new shapes

## Shape Choice
- RANDOM: a random shape with 3-100 vertices
- HEART: a uniform heart shape
- SQUARE: a uniform square
- CIRCLE: a uniform square
- TRIANGLE: a triangle whose top point position varies

### Notes
If you change the dot amount to 100_000 the shapes become mostly filled in.
