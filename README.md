# ðŸ’» Graham Scan Visualization Tool

This is a tool to visualize the Graham Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull of random points.

## ðŸ’„ Customization

![screenshot of the customization menu](https://i.imgur.com/aKGXWw9.png)
- select which shape to generate points in
- random shape generation
- change the amount of dots
- change the delay and step size to control the speed of the algorithm
- toggle visibility of both the dots and the lines showing the hull
- a "loop" option to continue generating and finding the hull of new shapes

## ðŸŸ©Shape ChoiceðŸŸ¢
![screenshot of the dropdown menu to select shape](https://i.imgur.com/F3UmiPV.png)
- RANDOM: a random shape with 3-100 vertices
- HEART: a uniform heart shape

- SQUARE: a uniform square
- CIRCLE: a uniform square
- TRIANGLE: a triangle whose top point position varies

### ðŸ““ Notes
If you change the dot amount to 100_000 the shapes become mostly filled in.
